# React + Vite

Priority Explanation
In Java, I’ve used priority queues to manage tasks by importance, where smaller values mean higher priority. I applied the same concept here in React with a PRIORITY_MAP. It assigns "High" to 1, "Medium" to 2, and "Low" to 3.

When sorting tasks, I compare these mapped values to ensure that higher-priority tasks appear first. This approach mirrors what I’ve done before with Java’s priority queues, ensuring important tasks are handled promptly.
